## 🎯 What is this magical thing?

Imagine having multiple AI assistants, but instead of constantly babysitting them with endless "Accept" clicks... **you just let them run wild.**

This extension is your personal **"Click-Avoidance System"** for Antigravity AI. It automatically accepts file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts so you can run multiple AI agents in parallel without constant supervision:

- ☕ Make coffee while your agents refactor code
- 🎮 Play games while they debug issues
- 🛌 Take naps while they write tests
- 📱 Scroll TikTok while they build features

**Zero babysitting. Maximum productivity.**

## 🎭 The Problem: Click Fatigue is Real

```
Your workflow WITHOUT Auto Accept:

Agent: "Should I edit this file?"
[You click Accept] ⏱️ 2 seconds

Agent: "Should I run this command?"
[You click Accept] ⏱️ 2 seconds

Agent: "I got stuck, retry?"
[You click Accept] ⏱️ 2 seconds

Agent: "Another file edit?"
[You click Accept] ⏱️ 2 seconds

...repeat 47 times per hour...

Total time lost: ~1.5 hours/day 🤯
```

## ✨ The Solution: Your New Lazy Life

```
Your workflow WITH Auto Accept:

[You install extension] ✅
[You launch Antigravity] ✅
[You go do literally anything else] 🎉

Agents work. You chill. Everyone wins.
```

## 🛡️ Safety First (We're Not Crazy)

We know what you're thinking: *"Won't my agents accidentally delete the universe?"*

**Nope.** We've got your back with:

- 🚫 **Dangerous Command Blocking** — Commands like `rm -rf /` get blocked automatically
- ⚙️ **Custom Blocklist** — Add your own forbidden commands
- 🎨 **Visual Status Overlay** — See what's happening at a glance:
  - 💜 **Purple** = Agents are working hard
  - 💚 **Green** = Task complete, victory achieved

## 🔧 Building from Source

Don't trust precompiled binaries? We respect that. Here's how to build it yourself:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/BornSupercharged/antigravity-auto-accept.git
cd antigravity-auto-accept

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the VSIX
npx vsce package --allow-missing-repository
```

This creates `antigravity-auto-accept-x.x.x.vsix` which you can install via:
- **VS Code/Cursor**: `code --install-extension antigravity-auto-accept-x.x.x.vsix`
- **Or**: Right-click the `.vsix` file → "Install Extension VSIX"

3. **Customize your blocklist** — Add commands you're paranoid about
4. **Watch the purple glow** — It's oddly satisfying
